# Kubernetes GitOps

This directory contains all Kubernetes manifests managed by ArgoCD.

## Structure

```
kubernetes/
├── applications.yaml   # Root app-of-apps (applied during bootstrap)
├── appsets/            # ApplicationSets that generate ArgoCD Applications
│   ├── infra.yaml      # Generates apps for each chart in infra/
│   └── apps.yaml       # Generates apps for each chart in apps/
├── infra/              # Infrastructure Helm charts
└── apps/               # User application Helm charts
```

## How It Works

1. During bootstrap, `applications.yaml` is applied - this creates a root ArgoCD Application
2. The root app watches `appsets/` and applies the ApplicationSets
3. Each ApplicationSet scans its target directory (`infra/` or `apps/`) and generates an ArgoCD Application for each Helm chart found
4. ArgoCD syncs each Application, deploying the Helm charts to the cluster

## Adding a New Application

1. Create a new directory under `apps/` with a Helm chart:
   ```
   apps/
   └── my-app/
       ├── Chart.yaml
       ├── values.yaml
       └── templates/
   ```
2. Commit and push - ArgoCD will automatically detect and deploy it

## Sync Waves

ArgoCD syncs resources in order based on sync-wave annotations:

| Wave | Resources |
|------|-----------|
| 0 | Namespaces |
| 10 | Infrastructure apps |
| 20 | User applications |

This ensures dependencies (like cert-manager) are ready before apps that need them.
