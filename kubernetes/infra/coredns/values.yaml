# Note: This deployment creates TWO services:
# 1. coredns (ClusterIP) - Auto-created by upstream chart, cannot be disabled
#    - Internal cluster service, unused in our setup
# 2. coredns-tailscale (LoadBalancer) - Custom service defined in templates/
#    - Exposed via Tailscale at dns.catfish-mountain.ts.net
#    - Used for Split DNS to resolve *.catfish-mountain.com → 100.96.89.36
